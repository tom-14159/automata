# Automata package for Haskell

In Ubuntu you need these extra packages to compile the module and application for drawing piecewise-testable languages:

- libghc-missingh-dev,
- libghc-temporary-dev (for the p-t app),
- libghc-readline-dev (libreadline-dev, libncurses5-dev, for the p-t app),
- graphviz (to draw graphs "out of the box").

`$ sudo apt-get install libghc-missingh-dev libghc-readline-dev libghc-temporary-dev graphviz`
